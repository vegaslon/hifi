 * @property PICK_INCLUDE_INVISIBLE {number} A filter flag.  Include invisible objects when intersecting.
 * @property PICK_INCLUDE_NONCOLLIDABLE {number} A filter flag.  Include non-collidable objects when intersecting.
 * @property INTERSECTED_NONE {number} An intersection type.  Intersected nothing with the given filter flags.

     *   with PickType.Ray, depending on which optional parameters you pass, you could create a Static Ray Pick, a Mouse Ray Pick, or a Joint Ray Pick.
     *
     * @typedef {Object} Picks.PickProperties
     * @property {boolean} [enabled=false] If this Pick should start enabled or not.  Disabled Picks do not updated their pick results.
     * @property {number} [filter=Picks.PICK_NOTHING] The filter for this Pick to use, constructed using filter flags combined using bitwise OR.
     * @property {float} [maxDistance=0.0] The max distance at which this Pick will intersect.  0.0 = no max.  < 0.0 is invalid.
     * @property {string} [joint] Only for Joint or Mouse Ray Picks.  If "Mouse", it will create a Ray Pick that follows the system mouse, in desktop or HMD.
     *   If "Avatar", it will create a Joint Ray Pick that follows your avatar's head.  Otherwise, it will create a Joint Ray Pick that follows the given joint, if it
     *   exists on your current avatar.
     * @property {Vec3} [posOffset=Vec3.ZERO] Only for Joint Ray Picks.  A local joint position offset, in meters.  x = upward, y = forward, z = lateral
     * @property {Vec3} [dirOffset=Vec3.UP] Only for Joint Ray Picks.  A local joint direction offset.  x = upward, y = forward, z = lateral
     * @property {Vec3} [position] Only for Static Ray Picks.  The world-space origin of the ray.
     * @property {Vec3} [direction=-Vec3.UP] Only for Static Ray Picks.  The world-space direction of the ray.
     * @property {number} [hand=-1] Only for Stylus Picks.  An integer.  0 == left, 1 == right.  Invalid otherwise.
