**Pick Parenting**

# What is a pick?

A pick calculates spatial information about the world on on the client.
Picks are immutable to allow efficient use by scripts. There are currently four types of picks:

- Ray pick - Finds the first intersected object along a straight path
- Parabola pick - Finds the first intersected object along a parabolic path
- Stylus pick - Finds the distance between a point and the XZ planes of a list of whitelisted objects
- Collision pick - Uses a volume to check for collisions in the physics engine

With the exception of collision picks, all picks use the visible appearance of the object to check for collisions.

# What is parenting?

Parenting allows an object's position, orientation, and scale (where applicable) to be calculated to another object. This collection of state defines the transform of the object.

Pick parenting allows the pick's transform to be calculated relative to another object, without creating a new pick.

# What can be parented to what?

# How pick parenting works

This section describes what happens when picks are parented to things.
Since pointers use picks to calculate their results, the rules below
also apply when pointers are parented to things.

## Parent transform exposed

The way a pick is moved/rescaled depends on its parent. In particular,
parenting to a pick actually parents to the pick's result, which
has no notion of scale. A pick can also be transformed relative to
a joint on a model, such as an avatar's hand.

Parent type:              | Entity/Avatar   | 3D Overlay   | Pick   
--------------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------
Has position              | yes             | yes          | yes    
Has orientation           | yes             | yes          | no     
Has scale                 | yes             | yes          | no     
Can have joints           | yes             | no           | no     

## Entity or overlay parent

Parenting a pick to an entity or overlay works similarly to
parenting entities to other things. However, unlike entities,
picks with scale will rescale their dimensions when
their parent rescales.

!!! WARNING
    Skew is not supported for collision picks. Scaling a parent entity or
    overlay non-uniformly can lead to inaccurate shapes for the child
    collision pick.

## Avatar parent

A pick parented to an avatar behaves like a wearable. It will maintain
its position relative to some point on the avatar's body. If the pick
has scale (currently only collision picks), then the pick will rescale
when the avatar rescales.

## Pick parent

Picks can also be parented to other picks.
When this is done, the child pick is actually parented to
the parent pick's result, not the pick itself.

A pick parented to another pick will have its position changed,
but not its orientation or scale.

# Effect of scale on picks

Scale affects the position and shape of picks, which in turn affects the pick result.
Scale currently does not affect the max distance of a pick.

## Ray and stylus pick scaling

Rescaling the parent of a ray pick or stylus pick can result in a translation of the pick.

## Collision pick scaling

Collision picks use the full transform of their parent (position, orientation, and scale/dimensions).
When first created, a collision pick's transform is defined in world space.
As the parent rescales, the collision pick rescales proportionally.

The collision pick's threshold also rescales. The change is proportional to the largest
dimension of the parent. So, if the largest dimension of the parent was 3.0 and is now 6.0,
the threshold doubles.
